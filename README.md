# MyfirstRepository
This is my first time creating a repository by myself, and i'm going to start introducing me.
My name is Isadora Xavier, and i'm a undergraduate at computer science, at UNICAP. Nowadays, i'm learning Java, and consequently there will be a lot of
softwares here with the Java language. I love a lot to solve problems, and Math is my favourite subject, and that's why i decided to make this course.
Here, in the github, you will can see both my own softwares, created by myself or from any programming site that have questions, and also my programms 
developed because of the activities from college. I hope you enjoy it, and anything else, you can talk with me.
